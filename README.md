# ELMFIRE

This repository documents the optimization and porting effort carried out for the Elmfire code at the [Intel Parallel Computing Center](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ipcc) at [CSC - IT Center for Science](https://www.csc.fi) 


The work was documented in two phases, [first was the initial porting to the Xeon Phi architecure](Initial_porting.md)

The second phase was [optimization and fixing of the OpenMP shared memory parallelism of the code](Optimization.md)

The test cases used to evaluate the performance is stored in:
